              Hi - I'm Rocky. In this talk: We'll be covering NetMonster, a game
              that no longer exists. I'll show you some netmonster fansites from
              the early 2000s internet. And... this talk is a very visual talk.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've embedded websites directly into these slides, and I won't
              necessarily read the content outloud. But this video is pretty
              high res so hopefully you can read all the funny bits... and you
              can always get the slides later. Let's jump right into it! (JUMP
              INTO SLIDES)
            </p>

            <p>
              (118 words) This is classic Pre-web 2.0 internet. So for anyone
              out of the loop...
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a "professionally" built site for the cult classic film,
              Space Jam. This site is real, it still exists. It has valid web
              code. (Click on Junior Jam)
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Again, very classic internet.</li>
              <li>It had excellent design tastes.</li>
              <li>It has animation.</li>
              <li>It has blue text on green background...</li>
              <li>Not to mention the table layout, and the banner?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And I want to emphasize... this was done by professionals.</p>

              (157 words) Sites that were built by novices... weren't exactly...
              different. This is also a real website, found in the wayback
              machine, roughly the year 2000.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                There's still table layouts. There's still some interesting
                color choices.
              </li>
              <li>There are banners and badges.</li>
              <li>
                There's a guest book and a web counter! (which the service is
                down so I made a green bar here)
              </li>
              <li>
                And what you don't hear... 2 minute Chrono Trigger audio midi
                file looping in the background.
              </li>
              <li>
                And there's even a Under Construction text! Because back then,
                you needed to be on the internet now. No staging sites for us!

            </ul>

            <p>
              This is a fan site dedicated to the game NetMonster. We'll come
              back to this site.
            </p>
            <p>
              I wanted to give you the glimpse of early 2000s internet, because
              this can be a culture shock if you're not familiar with yellow
              text on noisy backgrounds. We want to get that out of our system.

              And let's talk about NetMonster. This game existed from roughly
              1999 to 2001-ish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The thing I want to point out is this guy here -- this NetMonster
              badge. Because hidden on this web page is a collectable monster.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Show next monsters...) The monsters came in all sorts of weird
              shapes and sizes... The tagline of the game was -- Internet
              Monster Hunting at it's finest!

            <p>
              NetMonsters was free downloadable game from the late 90s, where
              you collect monsters from URLs.
            </p>

            <p>
              For Netmonster, it was very Pokemon-esque with collecting. How it
              worked was:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>The player would grab a URL with a NetMonster badge.</li>
              <li>The player would enter it in the game.</li>
              <li>
                Based on the code snippet, the game client would generate a
                monster.
              </li>
              <li>1 monster. 1 URL.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You need strong monsters to defeat the bad guys.</p>

            <p>
              The game stopped at version 1.4, because a hard drive crash erased
              the source code. And there was never a NetMonster V2.

            <p>
              And here's a crazy fact. The game has been abandoned for more than
              15 years... you can still run the NetMonster client today! It was
              written in .net, and works on Windows 10 machines! Absolute Tech
              marvel.

              Today, we cluster around massive community sites like Reddit and
              Facebook or specialized Wikis.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 2000s when we called it information superhighway...
              There was no Wikipedia!
            </p>
            <p>
              But there was a lot of people who wanted to share their
              knowledge... so they built websites. And often, it was free! So
              there was a industry of free website builders like Geocities, or
              Tripod or a dozen other free web hosts.

              To find these sites was still a challenge. Google was still being
              figured out in 2000. Searching existed. But good luck!
            </p>

            <p>
              Much of the internet was organized into topics, in what we called
              webrings. People made websites based on a specific topic, and then
              join a web ring.

              Really, very often... we just created shrines for our anime
              waifus. And you'd put your website on the webring. And now people
              can now find it.
            </p>

            <p>
              And going back to NetMonsters -- There were NetMonster websites.
              Because to catch NetMonsters, you needed to find websites with the
              netmonster badge, which means visiting the Netmonsters webrings,
              which means being familiar with fansites about NetMonsters.

              (120 words) And this is where we hit that sad point. Because that
              is a lie -- the internet isn't forever. This was a obscure game in
              2000. These fan sites are dead. You can't google NetMonsters and
              find anything about the game. I went to page 50 in the Search
              results...it's not there. These fansites... are gone from the
              modern web. Heck Geocities doesn't even exist anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              (next image) So I dug into the backups of of data hoarders,
              through geocities torrents, and through the wayback machine.... in
              order to find these fansites that no longer exist in the modern
              internet.

                We've gotten the early 2000s design out of our system, right?

                (highlight the left side) It's hard to see... Kragok provides a

            </p>
            <p>
              Darcie even organized the monsters into these categories for us.
              Thanks Darcie.

              Let's scroll back up to the H1. NetMonsters works on the freemium
              model. You can play for free. But to unlock everything, you had to
              spend $25. OR -- refer a bunch of people who bought it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Darcy is saying... refer me, help me get a premium license, and I
              will give you the secrets. So Darcie didn't make this site out of
              the goodness of their heart... they were entrepreneurial.

            <p>
              (53 words) Some sites had some missing or broken content. Like
              Powerpuffca, whose site looks like it was filled with a bunch of
              NetMonster images. Look at the right side -- all those 404 errors.
              What are you 'filename', and what visual attraction did you hold?
              But we'll never know.

                And now we reach the tale of Chris's NetMonsters. Unlike the
                other sites... Chris's story is more about Chris the person, the
                website author.
              </p>

              <p>
                Around the early 2000s, Chris hosted his Netmonster site a free
                hosting platform called vr9.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somewhere between fall-winter of 2000, Chris revamp his site to
                and went with a more 'table-design'. You can really start to see
                his hobby at it's peak on this page. Over 2400 monsters in his
                collection. But I also love that he shows off his specs.

                Something also fascinating happened in the year 2000. The dotcom

                And what I also know is... By 2005, that URL was redirected to

                Maybe Chris knew about living on the free web hosts. Because
                Chris migrated as much as he could to a new free hosting server
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of the design is still there. He even called his account
                NetMonster. But something missing? A lot of the details.
              </p>
              <p>
                But in 2003, just one year after the migration... something else
                happened. This time wasn't involving Dot com bursts or bubbles.

                In 2003, Chris changed. He revamped his website - the url is
                still the same. It still has the NetMonster URL. But now it's a
                blog about Latin.
              </p>
              <p>
                There's no references of NetMonster. It's sad. Real Toy Story 3
                level. But let's get to get real depressing now.

              There's a lot of sites I didn't even cover. But we can start to
              piece together this universe. And it's kind of poignant all of
              these missing pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              (Switch to camera) And here's the thing: I don't even like
              NetMonster! It was awful game!
            </p>

            <p>
              That's what makes me sad. I had a random thought about a random
              web game that I played for like two days in 1999.
            </p>

            <p>
              And you can't deny that there was a real history... that the
              modern internet has nothing about it. The internet is incredibly
              fragile. And if it wasn't for the Wayback machine, it would have
              been lost forever.
