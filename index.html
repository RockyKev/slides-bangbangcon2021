              If you're a certain age, you may remember the classic internet.
              Pre-web 2.0. A little bit for anyone out of the loop.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is aa "professionally" built site for the cult classic film,
              Space Jam. If you are familiar with this, noice.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is totally a real site. You can still visit it. All valid web
              code. (Click on Junior Jam)
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Again, very classic internet.</li>
              <li>First, we had excellent design tastes.</li>
              <li>We knew all about animation.</li>
              <li>And that blue text on green background... chefs kiss.</li>
              <li>Not to mention the table layout, and the banner?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And I want to emphasize... this was done by professionals.</p>

              Sites that were built by amateurs... weren't exactly... different.
              There's still table layouts. There's still some interesting color
              choices.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are banners and badges. There's a guest book! And a web
              counter! (which by the way, is disabled because the service was
              down.) And what you don't hear... 2 minute Chrono Trigger audio
              midi file looping in the background.
            </p>

            <p>
              And there's even a Under Construction text! Early web developers
              didn't need staging sites. We were coding live! When you got on
              the internet, you had to get it up fast!

            <p>
              This is a fan site dedicated to the game NetMonster. We'll come
              back to this site.

            <p>
              I wanted to give you the glimpse of early 2000s internet early,
              because it's not about the table layouts or the banners or the
              yellow text on noisy backgrounds... it's about the world. So...
              we're getting that out of our system.

              NetMonsters was free downloadable game from the late 90s. The
              player's job was to collect monsters and... (this is straight from
              the guide)
            </p>

            <p>
              stop Shade and his evil Minions from destroying websites, clogging
              up Phone Lines, and generaally making the Internet an unpleasant
              place to surf.
            </p>
            <p>
              The player would download the NetMonster client, grab a special
              URL, and with that URL, the client would generate a monster that
              you try to capture. 1 monster, 1 web Page.

              netmonsters lasted from 1999-2003. Even though the game has been
              abandoned for more than 15 years... you can still run the
              NetMonster client today! It was written in .net, and works on
              Windows 10 machines! Absolute Tech marvel.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game stopped at version 1.4, because a hard drive crash erased
              the source code. And there was never a NetMonster V2.

            With the source code lost -- we don't know how exactly monsters get
            generated any more. So in order to talk hypothetically about lost
            code, I want to present a analog to NetMonster, the game that
            inspired it... the Monster Rancher Series. (And really Monster
            Rancher 2)

            In the Monster Rancher Series-- The way Monster Rancher worked was
            that you would insert a CD, and based on the Table of Contents data,
            that would determine what kind of monster would be generated. It
            would go through a bunch of conditionals, decide the type of
            monster, the variant, and some other attributes.

              And a a side note -- Monster Rancher had a sweet gimmick - If you
              put a Pearl Jam CD in, you can get a Jam related monster. Or the
              Harry Potter DVD, and you can get a Owl monster.

            <p>
              It was also an excuse about why you own a Smashmouth CD. No
              seriously what I'm not... I own the CD because of the sweet
              monster you get. It Doesn't make sense not to live for fun.

              For Netmonster, rather than CDs... it was URLs. Similar process.

              <li>The player would grab a URL with a NetMonster badge.</li>
              <li>The game Client would look for the badge within the URL.</li>
              <li>
                Based on that code snippet, the game client would generate a

            <p>
              Collecting was a huge part of NetMonster. You need strong monsters
              to defeat the bad guys. And the early internet was different.
              Today, we cluster around massive community sites like Reddit and
              Facebook or specialized Wikis.

              And this is where we hit that sad note. This was a obscure game in
              2000. These fan sites are dead. You can't google NetMonsters and
              find anything about the 2000 game. Not even if you go to page 50
              in the Search results...trust me. They're... gone from the modern
              web. Geocities doesn't even exist anymore.

            <p>Because the talk is called [TALK NAME]...</p>
            <p>
              I had to dig deep into the repositories of data hoarders, through
              geocities torrents, and through the wayback machine. Many many
              hours of diggint through to find the handful of fan sites. Little
              Internet Worlds that are forever hidden in internet archives.

            <p>This is Kamek's Kastle. His banner alt tag is interesting.</p>

            <p>
              If we scroll down... he has a bunch of really sweet material for
              the NetMonster visitor. There's even comics, which unfortunately
              leads to broken images.
            </p>

            <p>And I want to show this random story off. April 1, 2000.</p>
            <p>
              NetMonster sucks! Why do I even have this page up anymore? I'm
              erasing this page tomorrow and I just uploaded a virus to your
              computer for even daring to play NM!
            </p>
            <p>WAAAAT. Kamek how could you?</p>
            <p>But if you read the next line... APRIL FOOL. Ah you joker.</p>

            <p>
              This is Darcie's NetMonsters. Let's ignore the H1 for a bit and
              scroll to the goods. It's really cute. Dogs - woof, take us home!
              Awww... Darcy. Darcy was a helpful member of the NetMonster
              community, organizing the monsters into these categories for us.
              Thanks Darcie.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's scroll back up to the H1. NetMonsters works on the freemium
              model. You get a free license, but the actual license is $25.
              Darcy is saying... refer me, help me get a premium license, and I
              will give you the secrets. So Darcie didn't make this site out of
              the goodness of her heart... and that's awesome.

                I have to put on my Indiana Jones hat to really dig into the
                pieces available. We live with this believe that "you can't
                truly delete anything from the Internet?", which we are finding
                is no longer true.
              </p>
              <p>
                And now we reach the tale of Chris's NetMonsters. Unlike Kragok
                who wanted to share his art, or Kamek who wanted people to know
                about his world, or Darcie who wanted to help people... Chris's
                little world was more about Chris the person.
              </p>

              <p>
                Around the early 2000s, Chris made a website for NetMonster,
                hosting his site for free on a free hosting platform called vr9.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somewhere between fall-winter of 2000, Chris Chris wanted to
                revamp his site to have a more 'Sys Ops astetic', left the
                sidebar approach and went with a more 'table-design'. You can
                really start to see his hobby at it's peak on this page. 2393
                monsters in his collection. But I also love that he shows off
                his specs.

                Something also fascinating happened in the year 2000. The dotcom
                bubble burst. I don't know how Chris' free web service, VR9 was
                affected. I just know that a few months later, this happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                And what I also know is... By 2005, VR9 was scooped up in some
                salvage sale and was redirected to the site on the right.

                Maybe Chris knew that living on the free internet had it's bad
                sides. Free services were spotty. Because Chris migrated as much
                as he could to a new free hosting server... dyndns.org.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of the design is still there. But something missing? A lot
                of the charm.
              </p>
              <p>
                But in 2003, just one year after the migration... something else
                happened. This time wasn't involving Dot com bursts or bubbles.

              I could have spent an additional 100 of hours digging through the

              I'm not even a fan of this game!

            <p>
              NetMonsters was awful! Battling was random and the monsters were
              ugly! It was a random thought about a random web game that I
              played a week of in 1999.

              But you can't deny that there was a history, a community... a
              sadness that the modern internet didn't have much about it. The
