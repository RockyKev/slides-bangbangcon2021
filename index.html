              (118 words) This is classic Pre-web 2.0 internet. So for anyone
              out of the loop...

            <p>
              This is a "professionally" built site for the cult classic film,
              Space Jam. This site is real, it still exists. It has valid web
              code. (Click on Junior Jam)

              <li>It has animation.</li>
              <li>It has blue text on green background...</li>
              <li>Not to mention the table layout, and the banner?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>And I want to emphasize... this was done by professionals.</p>

              (157 words) Sites that were built by novices... weren't exactly...
              different. This is also a real website, found in the wayback
              machine, roughly the year 2000.

            <p>
              I wanted to give you the glimpse of early 2000s internet, because
              this can be a culture shock if you're not familiar with yellow
              text on noisy backgrounds. We want to get that out of our system.
            </p>

            <p>
Also I want to point out that this will be a very visual talk. I've embedded websites directly into these slides, and I won't necessarily read the content outloud. But this is in 1920 resolution and you can always get the slides later.

              And let's talk about NetMonster. This game existed from roughly
              1999 to 2001-ish.
            </p>
            <p>
              The thing I want to point out is this guy here -- this NetMonster
              badge. Because hidden on this web page is a collectable monster.
            </p>
            <p>
              The monsters came in all sorts of weird shapes and sizes... The
              tagline of the game was -- Internet Monster Hunting at it's
              finest!

              NetMonsters was free downloadable game from the late 90s, where
              you collect monsters from URLs.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is directly from the game: Your goal was stop Shade and his
              evil Minions from destroying websites, clogging up Phone Lines,
              and generally making the Internet an unpleasant place to surf.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game stopped at version 1.4, because a hard drive crash erased
              the source code. And there was never a NetMonster V2.
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
              The player would download the NetMonster client, grab a special
              URL, and with that URL, the client would generate a monster that
              you try to capture. 1 monster, 1 web Page.

              And here's a crazy fact. The game has been abandoned for more than
              15 years... you can still run the NetMonster client today! It was
              written in .net, and works on Windows 10 machines! Absolute Tech
              marvel.

            (54 words) In the Monster Rancher Series-- The way Monster Rancher
            worked was that you would insert a CD, and based on the Table of
            Contents data, that would determine what kind of monster would be
            generated. It would go through a bunch of conditionals, decide the
            type of monster, the variant, and some other attributes.

              And a a side note -- Monster Rancher had a sweet gimmick - If you
              put a Pearl Jam CD in, you can get a Jam related monster. Or the
              Harry Potter DVD, and you can get a Owl monster.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also an excuse about why you own a Smashmouth CD. No
              seriously what I'm not... I own the CD because of the sweet
              monster you get. It Doesn't make sense not to live for fun.

              But there was a lot of people who wanted to share their

              Much of the internet was organized into topics, in what we called

              can now find it.

            <p>
              And going back to NetMonsters -- There were NetMonster websites.
              Because to catch NetMonsters, you needed to find websites with the
              netmonster badge, which means visiting the Netmonsters webrings,
              which means being familiar with fansites about NetMonsters.

              obscure game in 2000. These fan sites are dead. You can't google
              NetMonsters and find anything about the game. I went to page 50 in the Search results...it's not there. These fansites... are gone

                Many of these fan sites had pages upon pages of empty html files
                with a single button (and sometimes a banner). This is a actual
                web page.

            <p>
              If we scroll down... he has a bunch of really sweet material for
              the NetMonster visitor. There's even comics, which unfortunately
              leads to broken images.

            <p>And I want to show this random story off. April 1, 2000.</p>
            <p>
              NetMonster sucks! Why do I even have this page up anymore? I'm
              erasing this page tomorrow and I just uploaded a virus to your
              computer for even daring to play NM!

              This is Darcie's NetMonsters. Let's ignore the H1 for a bit and
              scroll to the goods. It's really cute. Dogs - woof, take us home!
              Awww... Darcy. Darcy was a helpful member of the NetMonster
              community. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Darcie even organized the monsters into these categories for us.
              Thanks Darcie.

            <p>
              Let's scroll back up to the H1. NetMonsters works on the freemium
              model. You can play for free. But to unlock everything, you had to spend $25.
              OR -- refer a bunch of people who bought it. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Darcy is saying... refer me, help me get a premium license, and I
              will give you the secrets. So Darcie didn't make this site out of
              the goodness of their heart... they were entrepreneurial.

                And now we reach the tale of Chris's NetMonsters. Unlike the other sites... Chris's
                little world was more about Chris the person.
              </p>

              <p>
                Around the early 2000s, Chris hosted his Netmonster site a free hosting platform called vr9.
              </p>

              <p>
                Somewhere between fall-winter of 2000, Chris                 revamp his site to have a more 'Sys Ops astetic' and went with a more 'table-design'. You can
                really start to see his hobby at it's peak on this page. Over 2400
                monsters in his collection. But I also love that he shows off
                his specs.

                Something also fascinating happened in the year 2000. The dotcom
                bubble burst. And that free host was affected. 
              </p>
              <p>
                And what I also know is... By 2005, that URL was redirected to the site on the right.
                But this isn't the end of Chris.

                Maybe Chris knew about living on the free web hosts. Because Chris migrated as much
                as he could to a new free hosting server... dyndns.org.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot of the design is still there. He even called his account NetMonster. But something missing? A lot
                of the details. 
              </p>
              <p>
                But in 2003, just one year after the migration... something else
                happened. This time wasn't involving Dot com bursts or bubbles.

              There's a lot of sites I didn't even cover. But we can start to piece together this universe. And it's kind of poignant.

              And the thing is -
              I don't even like this game! 
              NetMonsters was awful! There was too much randomness and the monsters were
              ugly! 
            </p>

            <p> And that's what makes me sad. 
              I had a random thought about a random web game that I
              played for like two days in 1999.
            </p>

            <p>
              But you can't deny that there was a real history... but the modern internet has nothing about it. The
              internet is incredibly fragile. And if it wasn't for the Wayback machine, it would have been lost
              forever.
