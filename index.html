            If you of a certain age, you may remember the internet of the early
            2000s. For us... it was the information superhighway..." A little
            bit about the early 2000s internet. First, we had excellent design
            tastes. Bold text on top of... noisy backgrounds. We understood
            animation. This is actually a "professionally" built site for the
            cult classic film, Space Jam. and what's that i hear? Oh yeah, 10
            second audio loop of Hoobastank. What's that? And there's even a
            Under Construction sign! Because we didn't do staging sites back
            then, we coded our staging sites live!

            Sites that non-professionals built... weren't exactly... different.
            There's still table layouts. There's still some interesting color
            choices. There are banners and badges. And a web counter! (which by
            the way, is disabled because the service was down.) And what's that?

            browser-based game from 1999-2003, where you are a member of the
            Resistance Corps out to collect monsters and stop Shade and his evil
            Minions from destroying websites, clogging up Phone Lines, and
            generaally making the Internet an unpleasant place to surf. Internet

            The way Monster Rancher worked was that you would insert a CD, and
            based on the TOC data would determine what kind of monster was
            generated. It would go through a bunch of conditionals, decide the
            type of monster, the variant, and some other attributes.
