            If you of a certain age, you may remember the internet of
            the early 2000s. 
			
			For us... it was the information superhighway..."

			A little bit about the early 2000s internet.

			First, we had excellent design tastes.  
			Bold text on top of... noisy backgrounds.
			We understood animation. 
			
			This is actually a "professionally" built site for the cult classic film, Space Jam. 


			and what's that
            i hear? Oh yeah, 10 second audio loop of Hoobastank. What's that?
            And there's even a Under Construction sign! Because we didn't do
            staging sites back then, we coded our staging sites live!

				Sites that non-professionals built... weren't exactly... different.
				There's still table layouts. 
				There's still some interesting color choices. 
				There are banners and badges. 
				And a web counter! (which by the way, is disabled because the service was down.)

				And what's that? You don't hear it... 2 minute Chrono Trigger music midi file playing in the background. 

				And there's even a Under Construction text! Early 2000s web developers don't need so stinkin' staging sites.
				We were coding live!
				
				This is a fan site dedicated to the game NetMonster.

				We'll come back to this site.

            Because hidden on this web page is a NetMonster. NetMonsters was a
            browser-based game from 1999-2003, where you are a member of the Resistance Corps out to collect monsters and stop Shade and his evil Minions from destroying websites, clogging up Phone Lines, and generaally making the Internet an unpleasant place to surf.

            So in order to talk hypothetically about lost code, I want to

          <aside class="notes">
            The way Monster Rancher worked was that you would insert a CD, and
            based on the TOC data would determine what kind of monster was
            generated. It would go through a bunch of conditionals, decide the
            type of monster, the variant, and some other attributes.

            Explain Monster Rancher as well as the gimmick - If you put a Pearl
            Jam CD in, you can get a Jam related monster. Or the Harry Potter
            Playstation CD, and you can get a Owl monster. It was also an excuse
            about why you own a Smashmouth CD. No seriously what I'm not... I
            own the CD because of the sweet monster you get. It Doesn't make
            sense not to live for fun. [REFERENCE]

            For Netmonster, rather than CDs... it was URLs. Similar process. It

            purposely visit the internet. (dial tone) You were a navigator,
            explorer, a safari... person... who traversed this internet wild
            west of personal websites without the help of Google to take us
            around. And the ambitious techie types would claim a piece of the

            world. Really, the internet was a place so create a shrine for your

            Collecting Monsters was a huge part of NetMonster. How NetMonster
            players were -- hoarding URLS and having secret trades in seedy
            backalley IRC rooms. How this was all researched was through a
            handful of fan sites and a massive digging through the Wayback
            Machine, through Geocities Archives, and Datahoarder torrents.

				I could have spent 100 of hours digging through the past and finding more threads of a bygone era. 
				
				And the thing is - I'm not even a fan of this game! 
				NetMonsters was awful! Battling was random and the monsters were ugly! 

				But it was a random thought about a random game that I played a week of in 1999. 
				
				And the sadness that the modern internet didn't have much about it... 

				The interent is incredibly fragile. The Wayback machine was lucky enough to exist. Else this whole world would have been lost forever. "
