            (68 words) If you of a certain age, you may remember the intrent of
            the 2000s. First, we had excellent design tastes, with a love of
            comic san, noisy backgrounds, pink on yellow text... and what's that
            i hear? Oh yeah, 10 second audio loop of Hoobastank. What's that?
            And there's even a Under Construction sign! Because we didn't do
            staging sites back then, we coded our staging sites live!

            The thing I want to point out is this guy here -- this is a badge.
            Because hidden on this web page is a NetMonster. NetMonsters was a
            browser-based game from 1999-2003, where you battle and collected
            digital monsters to face the evil Shade and his 84 henchmen.

            The player would download the NetMonster client, grab a URL with the
            special NetMonster code on it, and the client would generate a
            monster that you keep. 1 monster, 1 web Page.

          <aside class="notes">
            A hard drive crash is why the project never went passed 1.4,
            released in MONTH 1999. (SOURCE?) Even though it's been abandoned
            for more than 15 years... you can still run the NetMonster code
            today! It was written in .net, and works on Windows 10 machines!

          NetMonster (Inspired by Monster Rancher)
          <aside class="notes">
            So in order to talk hypothetically about lost code, I want to
            present a analog to NetMonster, the game that inspired it... Monster
            Rancher.

          Screenshot of the CD table data.

          <aside class="notes">
            The way Monster Rancher worked was that you would insert a CD, and
            based on the TOC data would determine what kind of monster was
            generated. It would go through a bunch of conditionals, decide the
            type of monster, the variant, and some other attributes.

          Jam and Owl, with their CDs

          <aside class="notes">
            Explain Monster Rancher as well as the gimmick - If you put a Pearl
            Jam CD in, you can get a Jam related monster. Or the Harry Potter
            Playstation CD, and you can get a Owl monster. It was also an excuse
            about why you own a Smashmouth CD. No seriously what I'm not... I
            own the CD because of the sweet monster you get. It Doesn't make
            sense not to live for fun. [REFERENCE]

            For Netmonster, rather than CDs... it was URLs. Similar process. It
            looked at the URL is the primary generation method. It is possible
            to override the generation using the tags in the image field to give
            a custom name, class, image, and to select a Race/Element combo:
            [ROBERT CARLSON REFERENCE and screenshot] That would give you all
            sorts of stats and types.

            Today, we cluster around massive community sites like Reddit,
            Facebook, Instagram or specialized Wikis or forums. But in 2000, The
            internet wasn't tethered to you, no... you would make a ritual to
            purposely visit the internet. (dial tone) You were a navigator,
            explorer, a safari... person... who traversed this internet wild
            west of personal websites without the help of Google to take us
            around. And the ambitious techie types would claim a piece of the
            internet for themselves.

          Webring of Urd and Britney Spears

          <aside class="notes">
            Without a decent search engine, the internet instead was organized
            into neigherhoods of like-minded topics, often in tools called
            webrings. Web rings -- the veins that are holding together this
            world. Really, the internet was a place so create a shrine for your
            anime waifu or your pop-star snacku... and really let people know.

            With NetMonster, people started creating little worlds and
            communities. Remember, 1 URL == 1 monster. And so these worlds could
            be one of content and stories, or one that just had a single button
            on a URL.

            Collecting Monsters was a huge part of NetMonster. How NetMonster
            players were -- hoarding URLS and having secret trades in seedy
            backalley IRC rooms. How this was all researched was through a
            handful of fan sites and a massive digging through the Wayback
            Machine, through Geocities Archives, and Datahoarder torrents.
