<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net Monsters is a new game for the internet.&nbsp;
It coast $25 and is well worth the price.&nbsp; The closest thing to it
would be Pokemon, but Net Monsters is much better.&nbsp; You have many
goals, and new things to do are always being made!&nbsp; It's seemingly
endless.&nbsp; Any ways. Think scavenger Hunt, Classic games like battle
ship,&nbsp; A-life (you breed them and they have personalities), and Pokemon
all rolled into one!&nbsp; This game of coarse is a perfect addition to
our web site!&nbsp; I hope you enjoy this section of Random Access as much
as I do!

<h1>NOTE:  I need 2 more people to use me as a reference in order to get my licence, appone getting my licence, I will add to all the pages.  Plus, if you use me as your reference (dc13@hotmail.com) as an added bonus, I'll give you URLs for tons of Nodes, Bosses, Oracles, and Mysteries.
