    case 5: ost = "I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them."; break;
    case 6: ost = "When the rebel leader challenges me to fight one-on-one and asks, 'Or are you afraid without your armies to back you up?' My reply will be, 'No, just sensible.'"; break;
    case 7: ost = "When I've captured my adversary and he says, 'Look, before you kill me, will you at least tell me what this is all about?' I'll say, 'No.' and shoot him."; break;
    case 8: ost = "After I kidnap Princess Peach, we will be married immediately in a quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks' time during which the final phase of my plan will be carried out."; break;
    case 9: ost = "I will not include a self-destruct mechanism in Kamek's Kastle unless absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, it will not be a large red button labeled 'Danger: Do Not Push'. The big red button marked 'Do Not Push' will instead trigger a spray of bullets on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not clearly be labeled as such."; break;
    case 10: ost = "I will not send my Toadies to kill the infant who is destined to defeat the King of the Koopas -- I'll do it myself."; break;
    case 11: ost = "I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to show they pose no threat."; break;
    case 12: ost = "I will not waste time making my enemy's death look like an accident -- I'm not accountable to anyone and my other enemies wouldn't believe it."; break;
    case 13: ost = "I will make it clear that I do know the meaning of the word 'mercy'; I simply choose not show them any."; break;
    case 14: ost = "One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation."; break;
    case 15: ost = "All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be deferred until after the aforementioned disposal."; break;
    case 16: ost = "My undercover agents will not have tattoos identifying them as members of my organization, nor will they be required to wear military boots or adhere to any other dress codes."; break;
    case 17: ost = "The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, a last spaghetti dish, or any other form of last request."; break;
    case 18: ost = "I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such a device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the counter reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation."; break;
    case 19: ost = "I will design all doomsday machines myself. If I must hire a mad scientist to assist me, I will make sure that he is sufficiently twisted enough to never regret his evil ways and seek to undo the damage he's caused."; break;
    case 20: ost = "I will never utter the sentence 'But before I kill you, there's just one thing I want to know.'"; break;
    case 21: ost = "When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice."; break;
    case 22: ost = "I will not have a son. Although his laughably under planned attempt to usurp power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a crucial point in time."; break;
    case 23: ost = "I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father."; break;
    case 24: ost = "Despite its proven stress relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly."; break;
    case 25: ost = "No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not consume any energy field bigger than my head."; break;
    case 26: ost = "I will keep a special cache of low tech weapons and train my troops in their use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator and/or render the standard issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks."; break;
    case 27: ost = "I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter the line 'No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!' (After that, death is usually instantaneous.)"; break;
    case 28: ost = "No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually inaccessible vulnerable spot."; break;
    case 29: ost = "No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is probably someone just as attractive who is NOT desperate to kill me. Therefore, I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my bedchamber."; break;
    case 30: ost = "I will never build only one of anything important. For the same reason I will always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times, as well as a supply of Hyper Ethers."; break;
    case 31: ost = "If my Kastle comes under attack, I will immediately flee to safety in my prepared escape pod and direct the defenses from there. I will not wait until the troops break into my inner sanctum to attempt this."; break;
    case 32: ost = "Even though I don't really care because I plan on living forever, I will hire engineers who are able to build me a Kastle sturdy enough that, if I am slain, it won't tumble to the ground for no good structural reason."; break;
    case 33: ost = "I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into confusion."; break;
    case 34: ost = "All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves in the land will be pre-emptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief."; break;
    case 35: ost = "All naive, pretty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly, world weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick."; break;
    case 36: ost = "Any and all magic and/or technology that can miraculously resurrect a secondary character who has given up his/her life through self sacrifice will be outlawed and destroyed."; break;
    case 37: ost = "I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by."; break;
    case 39: ost = "I will not employ devious schemes that involve the hero's party getting into my inner sanctum before the trap is sprung."; break;
    case 40: ost = "I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let alone the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only key to the cell door on my person."; break;
    case 41: ost = "If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, I will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for them to grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age."; break;
    case 42: ost = "If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the forefront of my legions of Koopas, nor will I seek out my opposite number among his army."; break;
    case 43: ost = "If I have an unstoppable super weapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of keeping it in reserve."; break;
    case 44: ost = "Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time travel devices."; break;
    case 45: ost = "I will offer oracles the choice of working exclusively for me or being executed."; break;
    case 46: ost = "When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, Yoshi, or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and filching keys happens to follow him around."; break;
    case 47: ost = "I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans."; break;
    case 48: ost = "I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for the pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the other guy a sporting chance."; break;
    case 49: ost = "I will not rely entirely upon 'totally reliable' magic spells that can be neutralized by relatively inconspicuous talisman."; break;
    case 50: ost = "I will never use magic spells which can be lifted by any power other than my own, including special magic rings, talismans, runes, or the eye of a newt."; break;
    case 51: ost = "I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what in my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not draw my weapon, point it at him, say 'And here is the price for failure,' then suddenly turn and kill some random underling."; break;
    case 52: ost = "If an advisor says to me 'Lord Kamek, he is but one man. What can one man possibly do?', I will reply 'This.' and kill the advisor."; break;
    case 53: ost = "If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay him while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature."; break;
    case 54: ost = "I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come after me for revenge. The same applies to Pokémon."; break;
    case 55: ost = "If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will not send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to seize something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper."; break;
    case 56: ost = "I will not use Windows 2000 on my central computer system."; break;
    case 57: ost = "My main computers will run on an operating system completely incompatible with standard Windows and Macintosh portables."; break;
    case 58: ost = "I will make the main entrance to my fortress standard sized. While elaborate 60 foot high double doors definitely impress the masses, they are hard to close quickly in an emergency."; break;
    case 59: ost = "If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions in the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less people oriented position."; break;
    case 60: ost = "I will hire a team of board certified architects and surveyors to examine my Kastle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might not know about."; break;
    case 61: ost = "If the beautiful princess that I captures says 'I'll never marry you! Never, do you hear me, NEVER!!!', I will say 'Oh well' and kill her."; break;
    case 62: ost = "I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to double cross it simply because I feel like being contrary."; break;
    case 63: ost = "My legions of Koopas will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot learn to hit a man sized target at 10 meters will be used for target practice."; break;
    case 64: ost = "Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will carefully read the owner's manual."; break;
    case 65: ost = "If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically and toss off a one liner."; break;
    case 66: ost = "I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am."; break;
    case 67: ost = "My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be used."; break;
    case 68: ost = "If my advisors ask 'Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?', I will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them."; break;
    case 69: ost = "I will never accept a challenge from the hero."; break;
    case 70: ost = "I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural supports which intruders could use for cover in a fire fight."; break;
    case 71: ost = "I will not engage an enemy single-handedly until all my Koopas are dead."; break;
    case 72: ost = "Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they will be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames going through accessible tunnels at predictable intervals."; break;
    case 73: ost = "I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a disadvantage."; break;
    case 74: ost = "If I must have computer systems with publicly available terminals, the maps they display of my Kastle will have a room clearly marked as the Main Control Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main control room will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment."; break;
    case 75: ost = "My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who watches someone press a sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for fingerprints then subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence will trigger the alarm system."; break;
    case 76: ost = "If I capture the hero's star ship, I will keep it in the landing bay with the ramp down, only a few token guards on duty and a ton of explosives set to go off as soon as it clears the blast range."; break;
    case 77: ost = "No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be instructed to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full scale emergency."; break;
    case 78: ost = "I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past.  This is only reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one time only. If they want me to spare them again, they'd better save my life again."; break;
    case 79: ost = "To keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access."; break;

April Fool. :P</p><p>
Some real updates! I've merged my original page with this one to create Kamek's Kastle of Kool Krap. We've got NetMonster, GameShark, and KUB+ so far, as well as a kickass message board that's growing in popularity. If you have suggestions, please email them! The only page that has not been put back online is the NM Record List, which may not make it back. I've added the Shade's Tower Strategy Guide if you're having trouble defeating the evil Internet Wizard. The Shade Slayer Monument is up with its first two Slayers. Kamek is back in business!

News as of 03/20/2000:
<blockquote>School takes up a buttload of my time, as I predicted, and NetMonster doesn't interest me too much anymore. At least not until PTO finishes moving and gets the next version up and running. I've already "lost" the IRC chatroom due to a Nightstar channel service reset. So don't look for too many updates here until a new version comes out. However, I will be cruising the net on my cable modem (bwahahaha) and you can still find me on ICQ, etc. KUB+ is probably my main priority right now, and I'm starting to get it underway, but only time will tell when it will be ready. So, I'll continue to leave this page up for you MonsterHunters who still haven't caught all my NetMonsters yet. I'll be making new custom Pokemon NMs with my new video capture card (double bwahahaha) with Pokemon Stadium plugged in (triple bwahahaha), so expect some of the custom pictures to change, because not all the pictures I got for them are very decent.<p>
Crystal Hunters? As soon as I remember how to work the program I made for it, I'll probably resume it...</p><p>
Shade Slayer Monument? Email me a Print-Screen capture of the "The End" screen and I'll put your name up. (Please reduce the colors or convert to a smaller format if possible)</p><p>
Weekly Poll? Try bi-whenever-I-feel-like-it poll. :)</p><p>
Hall of Fame? Hall of Shame? ... Got any entries?</p><p>
My stats? Sure, I'll post 'em again, but I probably won't be too interested in battling until a newer version with the PVP bug fixes comes out. But if you build a battle cage, I will come. :)</p><p>
BTW, don't visit http://kamek.8m.com, it's been taken over by a malicious hacker who is against everything Kamek and will stop at nothing to take over the world... or was that The Brain?... Well, ciao for now.
